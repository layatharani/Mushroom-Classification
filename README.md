# Title: 
  UNCOVERING THE HIDDEN TREASURES OF THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM: A CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS

# Aim:
  Project to classify mushroom into 3 types such as Boletus, Lactarius & Russula using Deep Learning.

# Overview:
  Mushrooms are a type of fungi that grow in a variety of habitats, from forests
to fields to decomposing logs. They come in many different shapes, sizes, and
colors, and are used for food, medicine, and other purposes. A mushroom is a
fruitful body of fungus which is usually produced above the ground on soil or
other nutrients. We only concentrate on mushrooms and do not consider fungus
species. our purpose is the optical recognition of species which have cap , gills
underside of cap and astern and typically the full body is visible on the image.

  In this project we are classifying various types of Mushrooms that are found
on various regions of our planet. These Mushrooms are majorly classified into 3
categories namely Boletus, Lactarius & Russula. Deep-learning (DL) methods in
artificial intelligence (AI) play a dominant role as high-performance classifiers in
the detection of the Mushrooms using images. Transfer learning has become one
of the most common techniques that has achieved better performance in many
areas, especially in image analysis and classification. We used Transfer Learning
techniques like Inception V3, Resnet50V2, Xception that are more widely used
as a transfer learning method in image analysis and they are highly effective.
